> Tool for protein multiple sequence alignment based on a parallel hybrid multiobjective lion optimization algorithm method

This project is a ```C#``` implementation of a **parallel hybrid multiobjective lion optimization algorithm** to perform multiple sequence alignment. The project is object-oriented, where the structures of the optimization algorithm are well defined into different classes.

The project provides an user interface, based on Windows Forms. Thus, the ```.sln``` file opens the project with the interface and all algorithm classes. This tool runs exclusively on Windows OS.
